Since this is C++17, and we need the C++20 range/iterator traits for our algorithms, this directory bundles an amalgamation of the small subset of range-v3 that defines these concepts only and nothing else. These concepts avoid an extra dependency and ensure the concepts are similar to those of C++20. These concepts are under the futures namespace to avoid conflicts with other libraries.
